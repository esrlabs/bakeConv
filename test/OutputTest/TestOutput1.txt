TEST TEST name of the project: z.cpp TEST1 TEST1
TEST TEST Here we want source files TEST1 TEST1
TEST TEST $$(BAKE_SRC) TEST1 TEST1
TEST TEST some text is here TEST1 TEST1

We also have some special to replace: Autosar_on something for AUTOSAR

Here is the element of a bake array: test1
Here is the element of a bake array: test2
Here is the element of a bake array: test3
